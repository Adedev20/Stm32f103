# Stm32f103
Stm32s are little beasts. So i got a bluepill (stm32f103c8t6 to work with. This was an attempt at blinking 2 leds; PC13 onboard led and an extra one on PA3  and i did this the baremetal way!!!...i.e no HAL libraries or drivers. I guess it's safe to say everything is pointers and addresses.
